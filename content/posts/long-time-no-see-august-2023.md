Zero posts for last month. What have I been doing? A very short summary of my August.
<!--more-->

## Working

Not gonna lie, huge part of my summer vacations is just work. Now, on my summer break I have a lot of time and naturally I'm using a chunk of it to make some more money. I'm really glad for this time at work because I learned a lot this summer and I know *this* knowledge will be useful in the future (as well as now).

## Chilling

As I mentioned despite everything it was my summer break and I was *chilling* a lot. After work just sat down and do something what doesn't need extra brainpower. The first thought that comes to my mind is the fact I watched some TV Series! Yes, it's not so usual for me.

A few days ago I watched [Perfect Blue](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156887/) and Oh My God. It was so good, shocking and provoking reflection. I don't want to spoiler it to you. Just watch it.

I watched also the [Silo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/) produced by Apple TV and it was great. The story, characters and the intrigue holding in suspense. I also recommend you watching this post-apo masterpiece.

Can't remember other things I watched this month so those two have to be sufficient :)

## Making an mobile application

I like the [C# Programming Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and wanted to make an mobile app. There's solution for this problem called MAUI (which replaced [Xamarin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/what-is-xamarin)) and despite other problems related to this frameworks I've decided to make an simple app using this stack.

More details I will cover in a separate post but for now I can tell you that it's nothing big and it's core functionality is to bring back the Android feature removed back in 10th version of this operating system, which is possibility to share text content directly to the clipboard meaning that copying it.

For now you can follow the project on it's GitHub site:

## Building a home server

Another topic that deserves it's own post. After all those years I started building my own Proxmox-powered *powerful* home server. I previously had many ideas how to bite this subject but in the end I end up with normal Desktop PC that acts like a server. For sure I will write some more about this setup in the future but for now like in case of the mobile app, I cant tell you too much.

But I can present you it's current, not so power consumption friendly configuration:
- Ryzen 3 1200 AF 4x 3.1 GHz
- MSI B450-A PRO MAX
- Kingston Fury 32 GB RAM 3200 MHz
- AMD R5 340X 2GB (temporary graphics solution)
- Goodram 240 GB SATA SSD (System)
- 2x 500 GB HDD (for playing with TrueNAS)

As you can see it's nothing special for now. I'll expand this config in the future by some much bigger drives, external SATA controllers, faster network cards and RAID for the system but it's quite expensive to buy everything at once.

## Conclusion

It was a good time and it's sad we have to change our habits again.
