The first welcome post. I guess that's how you do it on blogs isn't it?
<!--more-->

## What and why

I would like to treat this blog as a kind of diary, where I can spill my random thoughts or observations. Sometimes maybe there will be some writing on a particular topic or a series of articles. I also do not exclude tutorials, because sometimes I happen to help people then all in all why not collect it here ~~and then send them an article~~. In the end, in general, I don't know what I'm going to write about here, nor do I know if I will.

I wish I'll get better at writing with time. Now I'm trying to do this by writing half of the text by myself and the other half by using the [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/) whis is great by the way. I'm also trying to write in English because I want to improve my skills in this language. I'm not a native speaker so I'm sorry for any mistakes I make.

## The technical part

This blog is powered by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using [mini theme](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini). It's server side generated which means it should be fast and stable as a rock. Rocks are really fast if you throw them! I'm also hosting it on [mikr.us](https://mikr.us/?r=4b538b41)&nbsp;*(referral)* which is a really cool and cheap VPS provider.

Setting up this site took me like 2.5 hours, which I think is a really good score. I was scared it will be much more complicated because I don't like with web development because it's a mess which can fall apart at any moment. But it was really easy and I'm happy with the result.

I also want to modify the CSS a bit in the near future, because I don't like everything in this theme. A couple of things I will also have to fix, because currently they do not work at all, such as RSS.

## Link Start!

So the adventure begins! I hope I will be able to write something interesting here. I'm not sure if I will be able to write something every week, but I will try to do it as often as possible. I hope you will enjoy it.
