I saw an interesting [TLD][tld] so I bought a domain with it but for what I'm going to use it?
<!--more-->

## What is the TLD?

The [TLD][tld] is `.みんな` or `.xn--q9jyb4c` if you're using [Punycode][punycode].
I thought it will be cool to have one unusual domain just for fun, some real random content and it's uniqueness has just additional points.

The mysterious `みんな` actually means `everyone` in japanese and you can write it in [Rōmaji][romaji] as `minna`.

The domain itself was pretty cheap, to be exact it was $7.40/yr with same renew cost.

## For what?

Yyym. I'm glad you asked! Because I have to think about it.

The idea is to have some separate domain for not so official stuff, some place where I can put everything I want to and don't link this directly to the main [ezioleq.com][ezioleq] page. As an example I can host some pictures of cute ~~anime girls~~ cat~~girl~~s and the *new* domain just looks unusual and unique!

To be honest I don't know for what I'm gonna use it but it's good to have some sort of an alternative. One safe space to do something for pure fun and don't think if it's alright to relate with the "official" stuff. I don't know if you get it and I don't know if I'm writing it right but yeah, it is just for fun.

## What's the domain???

- Hiragana URL: [https://ezilque.みんな/][ezilque]
- Punycode URL: [https://ezilque.xn--q9jyb4c/][ezilque-punycode]

You got what you asked for. Now you can go.  
For now this domain is just redirecting to this blog so you have to wait for *the fresh* content.
