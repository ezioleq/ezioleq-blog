## About me

I'm a programmer, currently working as a Junior C# Developer and still learning in the upper secondary school. I'm interested in gamedev, systems administration, and sometimes even low-level stuff. I use arch by the way.

This blog is a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas. I hope you'll find something interesting here. And I wish you won't die of cringe while reading my posts.

*This description will be replaced with a better one when I'll have better ideas.*
